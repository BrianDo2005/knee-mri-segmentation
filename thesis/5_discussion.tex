\section{Discussion}

The application of convolutional neural networks for the segmentation of bones in MRIs has showed to be an effective measure when compared to other methods like ray casting or multi-atlas registration.

Most importantly, I presented an algorithm




CNNs sind super für Segmentierungen

Größe des Netzes spielt nicht immer eine entscheidene Rolle

Correlation von Knochen und Epifugen zum Alter ist vorhanden




The purpose of the Discussion is to state your interpretations and opinions, explain the implications of your findings, and make suggestions for future research. Its main function is to answer the questions posed in the Introduction, explain how the results support the answers and, how the answers fit in with existing knowledge on the topic. The Discussion is considered the heart of the paper and usually requires several writing attempts.

\section{Introduction}

Recent advances in Artificial Intelligence have led to fully automated workflows that often exceed human performance. State of the art neural networks can classify images into thousands of categories more accurate and magnitudes faster than we can. They translate text between hundreds of languages, navigate cars autonomously through cities and detect intruders in computer systems. In most of these cases they have been trained on tens of thousands or even millions of data samples to reach their accuracy. 

Neural networks have also found great success in the medical field, where the requirements are quite different and the data sets are often much smaller. Although the same techniques can be applied, they need to be adjusted to match a particular problem. In many applications neural networks have been setting the current state of the art when it comes to different segmentation or classification tasks.

The age assessment is a challenging procedure to determine the chronological age of a person lacking legal documents. It exists to afford children provisions they are entitled to by law and to prevent adults from taking unwarranted advantage of these benefits. There is no method that offers an exact identification of the age, but several assessments are currently used that can be separated in two groups.

Personal interviews or examinations are held to gain an observation of physical or psychological features of the person. Besides the fact that these practices include a high amount of manual work comes the problem that they are also subjective to the person conducting the test. The other type of assessments use X-rays to observe physical traits like the collar bone, teeth or carpal growth plates. Besides that these images are also analyzed manually comes the problem that X-rays are considered an invasive imaging method because they require the exposure of ionizing radiation. In some european countries like Germany, these recordings can only be induced in a criminal matter and therefore not be used for refugee applications.

As such, there is a high demand for a fully automated, unprejudiced and non-invasive method for accurately determining the age of a person.

Based on this idea, I was introduced to a data set of MRIs showing the right knee of several candidates. In contrast to CT or X-ray, MRI is considered non-invasive. Similar to the carpal analysis, the three bones around the knee show growth plates which have been used as indicators for the age of a person. One downside of MRIs in this context is that they are much more sensitive to non-bone tissue in the human body.

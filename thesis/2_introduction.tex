Scope and Limitation

Recent advances in Artificial Intelligence have led to workflows that not only run fully automated but also often exceed human performance. State of the art neural networks can classify images into thousands of categories more accurate and magnitudes faster than humans. They translate text between hundreds of languages, navigate cars autonomously through cities and detect intruders in computer networks. In most of these cases they have been trained on tens of thousands or even millions of data samples.

Neural networks have also found great success in the medical field, where new types of problems were introduced based on datasets that are much smaller. Medical imaging data includes MRI, Ultrasound and CT of which the latter is an invasive methods because it uses electromagnetic radiation.

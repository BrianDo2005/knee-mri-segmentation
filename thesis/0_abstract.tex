The age assessment is a complicated procedure to determine the chronological age of a person lacking legal documents. No method offers an exact identification of the age, and current practices include the manual analysis of invasive X-ray images. Previous publications show that the condition of growth plates in the knee could be an appropriate indicator for the border to adulthood. As part of a DFG study, noninvasive MRI recordings were collected to investigate this hypothesis further. This thesis provides a step towards a solution by automating the extraction of bone in knee MRIs to reduce the data complexity. The segmentations show 98\% DSC using convolutional neural networks and further improve the work of previous studies. In the end, this data is used in a proof of concept to assess the age of patients with an MAE of 200 days.

The age assessment is a complicated procedure to determine the chronological age of a person lacking legal documents. There is no method that offers an exact identification of the age, while current practices also require high amounts of manual work and invasive X-ray imaging methods. Previous publications show that the condition of growth plates in the knee could be an appropriate indicator for the border to adulthood. As part of a DFG study, noninvasive MRI recordings were collected to investigate this hypothesis further. This thesis provides a step towards a solution by automating the extraction of bone in knee MRIs to reduce the data complexity. The segmentations show 98\% DSC using convolutional neural networks and further improve the work of previous studies. In the end, this data is used in a proof of concept to assess the age of patients with an MAE of 200 days.

\section{Conclusion}

In this thesis, I presented the development of a fully automated workflow based on convolutional neural networks, which segments bones in three dimensional MRI data of human knees. It shows an excellent performance of 98\% DSC while distinguishing between Femur, Tibia, and Fibula. The network even shows accurate results on sagittal images although it was entirely trained using coronal data. It is adaptable to changes in crop and resolution due to its fully convolutional structure. This also helps to visualize all of the layers in the network. Furthermore, I was able to combine the masked bone images with part of the architecture as a pre-trained model to assess the age of the candidates with an MAE of 200 days. All of this is possible using noninvasive magnetic resonance imaging.
